## Overview
This Java 2D Multi-threaded Physics Engine (J2DPE) is a physics engine designed specifically for Java-based 2D games and applications. By leveraging the power of multi-threading, the engine allows for smooth and realistic physics simulations in real-time. I made this code as a bit of a side quest so run it at your own risk! :)

## Features
Multi-threading: Harness the power of multiple CPU cores to run physics calculations concurrently, reducing lag and boosting performance.
Collision Detection: Efficient and accurate collision detection for circles.
Feel Free to build off this to make whatever you would like!
