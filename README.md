#Overview
The Java 2D Multi-threaded Physics Engine (J2DPE) is a high-performance, versatile physics engine designed specifically for Java-based 2D games and applications. By leveraging the power of multi-threading, J2DPE allows for smooth and realistic physics simulations in real-time, enabling developers to bring their creations to life.

#Features
Multi-threading: Harness the power of multiple CPU cores to run physics calculations concurrently, reducing lag and boosting performance.
Collision Detection: Efficient and accurate collision detection for circles.
